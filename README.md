# Devlog Entry - 11/14/24

## Introducing the team
+ Marco Ogaz-Vega - Engine Lead
+ Ayden Le - Design Co-Lead
+ Nick Corfmat - Tools Lead
+ Nathan Wiinikka - Design Co-Lead

## Tools and materials
Our team will be using the Phaser 3 game engine given our familiarity with this framework and its support for web-based 2D game development. The engine’s environment will allow us to quickly prototype and refine the grid-based game by providing us with the necessary tools for development. Built-in features like physics, animation, and input handlers are just some examples of the development tools that will allow us to design an enjoyable game experience.

For this project, we will be starting out with JavaScript, as it is Phaser’s native language and will allow us to utilize its API without having to worry about compatibility issues. Additionally, we will be storing and managing all of our game’s data using JSON, given the readability and low weight of this format. JSON is also highly compatible with JavaScript—a quality that will allow us to seamlessly integrate it with our game’s source code.

Visual Studio Code will be our team’s primary IDE for its overall familiarity and for its ease of integration with Github. Github will be our version controller for this project so VS Code’s compatibility with it will be a major help. As for asset creation, Piskel and Aesprite will be our primary resources as they are great 2D pixel editors with lots of features applicable to game development projects.

We plan to migrate from JavaScript to Typescript given the close similarities both languages share, as well as the benefits Typescript offers. We will continue using Phaser as our primary game engine, however, we will have to modify our original code to account for differences between JavaScript and Typescript. For example, adding strict type-checking to functions and variables to ensure the game’s code is less susceptible to breaking and ensuring this change remains consistent with Phaser API function calls.

## Outlook
As a team, we are hoping to avert expectations about the aesthetic and design decisions in order to accomplish all the required elements of the assignment in a fun and unique way. One way we might do this is changing the overall farming aesthetic to something like sci-fi or fantasy. On the design front, we might implement Three.js in order to render 3-D game objects in a browser framework. We are hoping to use our combined academic experience in Phaser 3 through our course work at UCSC to make a nice foundation for us as we continue to learn more about the engine and experiment with new libraries. We anticipate that learning typescript in the context of Phaser 3 will be our biggest hurdle as we all do not have much experience with these two in tandem.
